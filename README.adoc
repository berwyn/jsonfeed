= JSONFeed Parser

This is a http://jsonfeed.org[JSONFeed] parser in Rust. Just a thin layer on top of `serde`, but it
provides serialization & deserialization, along with a Builder API for constructing feeds.

Note that this is alpha, I still need to add a lot of tests and a couple more features.

== Example

----
extern crate jsonfeed;

use jsonfeed::{self, Feed};

fn main() {
	let source = "{...}";
	let feed: Feed = jsonfeed::from_str(source).unwrap();
}
----

TODO:

* Tests. Lots and lots of tests
* Implement ability to add, serialize, and deserialize custom attributes from the json feed spec
